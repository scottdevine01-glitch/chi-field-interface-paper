This paper presents the interpretation of the χ-field in Anti-Entropic Cosmology as a cosmic interface regulating energy flow and providing a novel explanation for Dark Energy as structural boundary energy.

## Abstract

In my previous work on Anti-Entropic Cosmology, the AEP selected two fundamental fields: $\phi$ (the dynamical expanding substrate) and $\chi$. While the $\phi$-field's role is becoming clear, the $\chi$-field's purpose has remained somewhat mysterious. In this paper, I show that the $\chi$-field acts as a **cosmic interface** -- a boundary layer that regulates energy and momentum exchange across the expanding cosmos. This interface interpretation naturally explains why measurements of Dark Energy give such puzzling results: we're not measuring "extra stuff" in the universe, but rather the **structural energy** required to maintain the boundary.
